"In the last lesson, we looked at [code]while[/code] loops. We found they "

"[code]while[/code] loops can result in infinite loops if we're not careful."

"Unlike [code]while[/code] loops, [code]for[/code] loops don't run forever, "

"We'll explain arrays more thoroughly in the next lesson, but notice that "

"You may have heard of frames per second, or FPS for short. Games often run "

"Depending on the game, the computer, and what the game engine needs to "

msgstr ""

msgid "There will always be small variations from frame to frame."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"That is why the [code]_process()[/code] function receives a [code]delta[/"
"code] parameter."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Delta represents a time difference. It's the time it took Godot to complete "
"the previous frame, in seconds."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We can use it to make sure the game runs at the same speed on all computers."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is because different computers have different processing power, so a "
"fast computer will have more frames per second than a slow computer."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If we ignore [code]delta[/code], movement speed will vary depending on the "

msgstr ""

#: course/lesson-11-time-delta/lesson.tres:116
msgid ""
"[code]delta[/code] is the time it took Godot to complete the previous frame "

msgstr ""

msgid "It's very small because frames happen many times a second."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It varies each frame because Godot has more or less to process each frame."

msgstr ""

#: course/lesson-11-time-delta/lesson.tres:131
msgid ""
"The [code]delta[/code] you get in [code]_process()[/code] is a time "
"difference in seconds. It will generally be a tiny decimal number."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To apply [code]delta[/code], you need to [i]multiply[/i] your speed values "
"by it."
msgstr ""

#: course/lesson-11-time-delta/lesson.tres:153
msgid ""
"When multiplying by [code]delta[/code], you make motion [i]time-dependent[/"
"i] rather than [i]frame-dependent[/i]."
msgstr ""

msgid "That's essential to make your game consistent and fair."

msgid ""
"At the top of the lesson, we made the robot rotate a fixed amount every "
"frame: [code]0.05[/code] radians."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the example above, we now [i]multiply[/i] the argument by the very small "
"[code]delta[/code] value, a value much smaller than [code]1.0[/code]. It "
"makes the robot turn at a constant speed over time."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"However, multiplying by a number below [code]1.0[/code] like [code]delta[/"
"code] makes the result smaller."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To compensate for that and make the robot turn fast enough, we use a larger "
"number than before, [code]3.0[/code] instead of [code]0.05[/code]."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Those numbers have two different [i]units[/i]: [code]0.05[/code] is an "
"[i]angle[/i] in radians, while [code]3.0[/code] is an [i]angular speed[/i] "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When you multiply an angular speed by a time delta, it gives you an angle."

msgid "The time it takes to display a new frame varies."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you don't take that time into account in your code, your game will have "
"gameplay issues and bugs. Godot provides that time to the [code]_process()[/"

"In the example below, the top robot moves using [code]delta[/code]. As a "
"result, it moves at a fixed speed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The bottom robot moves over a constant distance every frame, [i]without[/i] "

msgstr ""

msgid "Thanks to that, we get reliable movement over time."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Frame times vary from computer to computer and from frame to frame during "

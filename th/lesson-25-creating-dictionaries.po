"In the last lesson, we used an array to represent a player's inventory.\n"
"\n"
"With just an array of item names, though, we can't easily keep track of "
"the amount of each item.\n"
"\n"
"Instead, we can bundle the item names and amounts into a single "
"[i]dictionary[/i].\n"
"\n"
"A dictionary is a data structure that allows you to map pairs of values. "
"In the pair, we call the first value a [i]key[/i] as we use it to access "
"the second.\n"
"\n"
"In other words, a dictionary has a list of [i]keys[/i], and each key "
"points to a [i]value[/i].\n"
"\n"
"To define a dictionary, we use curly brackets. A colon separates each key"
" and its value. A comma separates each key and value pair."

msgid ""
"Dictionaries are also called mappings or [i]associative arrays[/i]. Under"
" the hood, they use arrays and several functions to efficiently store and"
" retrieve values across arrays.\n"
"\n"
"Precisely, dictionaries use a [i]hashing algorithm[/i]. Hashing "
"algorithms convert one value into another.\n"
"\n"
"In this case, hashing consists of converting a given key into a unique "
"whole number. The dictionary then uses that number as an array's index!\n"
"\n"
"That's how a dictionary works: when you give it a key, it converts it "
"into a unique index and uses that index to retrieve the corresponding "
"value in the computer's memory.\n"
"\n"
"That's also why you can't have the same key twice: it would map to the "
"same array index, causing you to overwrite an existing value."

"Like with arrays, you can loop over dictionaries. You can loop over both "
"their keys and values.\n"

"To display the player's inventory, you need to know what it contains. You"
" need the name and amount of each object.\n"
"\n"
"And from code, you can only achieve that by looping over the whole "
"dictionary and processing key-value pairs one by one.\n"
"\n"
"To get the list of keys in the dictionary, you can call its "
"[code]keys()[/code] member function."

"But it's something we do so much that you don't need to call the "
"function.\n"
"\n"
"Instead, you can directly type the variable name in a [code]for[/code] "
"loop after the [code]in[/code] keyword. The language understands that you"
" implicitly want to loop over the dictionary's keys."

"You can get the values with the syntax [code]dictionary[key][/code] as "

"We can also use a dictionary to map units to their position on a game "

"\n"
"That's how you'd typically code a board game, a grid-based RPG, or a "
"tactical RPG.\n"
"\n"
"While we focused on [code]String[/code] keys so far, GDScript "
"dictionaries accept any value type as a key, allowing you to map anything"
" to anything.\n"

"The only limitation is that every key must be unique."

"A cyclic reference is when a class references itself, directly or "
"indirectly.\n"
"\n"
"It has two possible causes:\n"
"\n"
"1. You used the class name in the class itself.\n"
"2. Your code refers to another class that refers to this class, causing "
"an endless reference cycle.\n"
"\n"
"Either way, due to how GDScript works in Godot 3, unfortunately,you "
"cannot do this. Godot 4 should solve this problem, but you need to work "
"around it in the meantime."

"การอ้างอิงแบบวนซ้ำหรือ cyclic reference "
"คือเมื่อคลาสอ้างอิงตัวเองไม่ว่าจะโดยตรงหรือโดยอ้อม\n"
"\n"
"มันมีสาเหตุที่เป็นไปได้สองกรณี:\n"
"\n"
"1. คุณใช้ชื่อคลาสในตัวคลาสมันเอง\n"
"2. โค้ดของคุณอ้างถึงคลาสอื่นที่อ้างถึงคลาสนี้ "
"ทำให้เกิดวงจรอ้างอิงที่ไม่มีที่สิ้นสุด\n"
"\n"
"ไม่ว่าจะด้วยวิธีใด เนื่องจากใน GDScript จะทำงานใน Godot 3 "
"แต่โชคไม่ดีที่คุณจะไม่สามารถทำเช่นนี้ได้ใน Godot 4 ควรแก้ปัญหานี้ "
"แต่คุณเองต้องแก้ไขในระหว่างนี้"

"In previous lessons, you learned how to create arrays to store lists of "
"values and how to loop over them. It's nice, but you won't go far with "
"only that.\n"
"\n"
"The real strength of arrays is that you can add and remove values from "
"them at any time. It allows you to [i]queue[/i] or [i]stack[/i] data."

"You're making a restaurant management game where customers place orders, "

"How do you keep track of pending and completed orders? With an array!\n"
"\n"
"When a customer purchases a meal, you want to [i]append[/i] it to the "
"array. Then, as you complete a meal in the kitchen and serve it, you want"
" to remove it from the array.\n"
"\n"
"You can do that with the [code]append()[/code] and the "
"[code]pop_front()[/code] functions of the array, respectively.\n"
"\n"
"Try to read the code below before moving on. Don't worry if not "

"Functions like [code]append()[/code] and [code]pop_front()[/code] only "

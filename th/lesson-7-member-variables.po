"In this lesson, we take a first look at variables.\n"
"\n"
"In games, you need to keep track of many values that change over time:\n"
"\n"
"- The player's score.\n"
"- Every character or enemy's health.\n"
"- The last checkpoint.\n"
"\n"
"And so much more. You need to store, retrieve, and update those values.\n"
"\n"
"We call those values [i]variables[/i]. Variables are labels you use to "
"keep track of values that vary over time. Here's an example of a variable"
" tracking a character or monster's health."

"In this lesson, we start using variables built into Godot. They're a "
"particular kind called [i]member variables[/i].\n"
"\n"
"Member variables are values attached to a game entity. They're useful "
"properties like the [code]position[/code], [code]rotation[/code], and "
"[code]scale[/code] of a character.\n"
"\n"
"In a previous lesson, we saw how we could use the [code]rotate()[/code] "
"function to rotate our character."

"This function increases or decreases the value of the entity's "
"[code]rotation[/code] member variable.\n"
"\n"
"Say we want to reset the rotation to [code]0[/code] and make the "
"character upright. Using the [code]rotate()[/code] function can prove "
"difficult: you need to know the character's exact current angle to cancel"
" it out.\n"
"\n"
"It's much easier to use the member variable rather than the function.\n"
"\n"
"The following code assigns the value [code]0[/code] to the character's "
"rotation, resetting its angle and making it upright."

"In video games, you will see many member variables that have sub-values.\n"
"\n"
"For example, the [code]position[/code] we mentioned has two coordinates: "
"[code]x[/code] and [code]y[/code].\n"
"\n"
"It's the same for the [code]scale[/code]: it has [code]x[/code] and "
"[code]y[/code] sub-variables. They respectively control the horizontal "
"and vertical size of the game entity.\n"
"\n"
"To access those X and Y sub-components, you add a dot (\".\") after the "
"variable name.\n"

"\n"
"Unlike in maths, in computer programming, the equal sign (\"=\") does not"
" mean \"is equal to.\"\n"
"\n"
"Instead, it means \"assign the result of the expression on the right to "

"In math, the y-axis is generally positive going up by convention.\n"

"This may be confusing if you only saw the y-axis pointing up in math "

" to be perpendicular.\n"
"\n"
"On the computer, the position (0, 0) happens to correspond to the top-"
"left of your computer screen. It then makes sense for coordinates to be "
"positive when going towards the bottom-right corner.\n"
"\n"
"This leads to another question: why is position zero the top left of the "

"The turtle is a little machine that moves forward, turns, and draws lines"
" along its path.\n"
"\n"
"To make it draw, you give it a list of instructions: on each code line, "
"you call one specific function.\n"
"\n"
"We prepared several functions for you:\n"
"\n"
"- [code]move_forward(pixels)[/code] makes the turtle move forward over a "
"given distance in [i]pixels[/i].  \n"
"- [code]turn_right(degrees)[/code] makes the turtle turn to the right by "
"a precise amount of [i]degrees[/i].\n"
"- [code]turn_left(degrees)[/code] works the same as "
"[code]turn_right(degrees)[/code], except the turtle turns to the left.\n"
"\n"
"You'll use these functions the same way you used [code]rotate()[/code] "
"before.\n"
"\n"
"The turtle draws a white line as it moves. We'll use this line to draw "
"shapes.\n"
"\n"
"For example, to move the turtle 200 pixels, you would write "

"By default, GDScript is what we call a dynamically-typed language. That "
"means that you can just write variables, assign them a value with a "
"number, and assign them another value with a different type.\n"
"\n"
"Unlike in some other languages, in GDScript, the following code is valid."

"Games use grids all the time, be it for grid-based gameplay or to make "
"algorithms faster.\n"
"\n"
"When working with grids, you need to convert grid coordinates into "
"positions in the game world all the time. To do so, you give each cell a "
"size in pixels.\n"
"\n"
"You'll likely pick one of two types for that: [code]float[/code] or "
"[code]Vector2[/code].\n"
"\n"
"Either of those two values would be fine:"
msgstr ""

#: course/lesson-28-specifying-types/lesson.tres:71

"Using a [code]Vector2[/code] could simplify some calculations. For "
"example, when converting grid coordinates to game world coordinates."

msgid ""
"In this example, because both [code]cell[/code] and "
"[code]cell_size[/code] are [code]Vector2[/code] values, we can add them."
"\n"
"\n"
"However, if [code]cell_size[/code] is a [code]float[/code], we will get a"
" type error."

#: course/lesson-28-specifying-types/lesson.tres:123

"Worse: due to dynamic typing, we won't get an error [i]right away[/i]. We"
" will only get the error when calling [code]grid_to_world(Vector2(1, "
"1))[/code].\n"

"And that's a big problem."

"Because we're learning, we only have small code examples in this course. "
"But your games' code will get long and split into many files. When "
"coding, you often forget about the code you wrote several weeks ago.\n"
"\n"
"And with a lot of code, it could take [i]hours[/i] of play before players"
" trigger a type error in your code."

"Fortunately, GDScript has optional [i]type hints[/i].\n"
"\n"
"Type hints let the computer know the value type you want for variables "
"and report errors before running the code.\n"
"\n"
"To specify the type a variable can accept, you can write a colon and a "
"type after the name when defining a new variable."

"GDScript comes with a feature called [i]type inference[/i]. In many "
"cases, but not all, the computer can figure out the type of a variable "
"for you.\n"
"\n"
"To do so, you write [code]:=[/code], without the type. The computer will "
"set the type using the value after the equal sign. We could make "
"[code]cell_size[/code] a variable of type [code]Vector2[/code] like so:"

"This takes little typing, yet you get the benefits of using type hints, "

"When you give the language hints like that, it will [i]prevent[/i] major "
"type errors. When you work in Godot, you will see that the computer can "
"report issues as you write the code. It makes the benefit even greater.\n"
"\n"
"Type hints can also help improve the readability of your code. It can "
"help to put more information directly in the code. As we saw, types are "
"essential when coding, and when using type hints, the computer will add "
"them to the engine's built-in code documentation system.\n"
"\n"
"There's an incredible third benefit for you: by using type hints, you "
"will learn types much faster. It's excellent for learning.\n"
"\n"
"In the following practices, you will write the correct type hints to make"
" the code error-free."

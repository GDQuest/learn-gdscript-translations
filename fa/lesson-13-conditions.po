"Video games and other computer programs are full of conditions. For example, "

msgid ""
"When the computer checks a condition, this is called [b]to evaluate[/b] a "

"Either the player is pressing the button, or not. Either the character is "

"In our case, [i]if[/i] the health goes over a maximum value, we want to "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To define a condition, we use the [code]if[/code] keyword. We write a line "

"The [code]pass[/code] keyword prevents errors in our code when a line cannot "

"For example, we must have a line of code after a function definition or an "

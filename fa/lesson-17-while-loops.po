"You've seen that you can use functions to [i]reuse[/i] code. In this "
"lesson, you'll learn about [b]loops[/b]. Loops help you [i]repeat[/i] "

"Our robot can move to neighboring cells by changing a "
"[code]Vector2[/code] variable named [code]cell[/code]. It represents the "
"current cell the robot is in."

msgid "When we increase [code]cell.x[/code], the robot moves to the right."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that we delay the robot's movement in the app to help you visualize "
"how it moves. The following code would normally move the robot instantly."

"The above code works for a pre-defined board with a size of "
"[code]Vector2(3, 3)[/code], but the [code]move_to_end()[/code] function "
"wouldn't work if the size of the board was different."
msgstr ""

msgid "The robot would either stop before the end or go too far."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To implement a general solution for all board sizes, we can repeat the "
"robot's movement until it gets to the end."

"You can use a [code]while[/code] loop to make the computer repeat a block"

"Each time we go through the [code]while[/code] loop, we add "
"[code]1[/code] to [code]number[/code]."

"The [code]while[/code] loop keeps running for as long as the condition is"

"This time, we compare the number of loops to the board's width. We go "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that we move the robot until its position is one less than the "
"board's width because we are counting tiles from [code]0[/code]."

"A board of [code]3[/code] by [code]3[/code] cells would have cell "

"If you're not careful, your [code]while[/code] loop can run infinitely. "

msgid "What would happen if the computer tried to run the code above?"
msgstr ""

#: course/lesson-17-while-loops/lesson.tres:185
msgid ""
"Because we don't increment [code]number[/code] within the "
"[code]while[/code] loop, it always stays at [code]0[/code]."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As a result, the number is always lower than [code]10[/code], so we never"
" break out of the loop."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Since there's no way to exit the [code]while[/code] loop, the computer "
"will attempt to draw squares infinitely, which will freeze the program."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When programs stop responding on your computer, it's often due to an "

"At first, you will not need [code]while[/code] loops often. Even the code"
" we show here has more efficient alternatives."

msgid ""
"Also, there's a safer kind of loop, [code]for[/code] loops, which we'll "
"look at in the next lesson."

msgid ""
"Yet, [code]while[/code] loops have important intermediate to advanced-"
"level uses, so you at least need to know they exist and how to use them."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We use [code]while[/code] loops every time we need to loop an unknown "
"number of times."

msgid ""
"For example, games run in a loop that typically generates sixty images "
"per second until the user closes the game. This is possible thanks to "
"[code]while[/code] loops."
msgstr ""

msgid "There are other good uses for [code]while[/code] loops:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"- Reading and processing a file, like a text document, line by line.\n"
"- Processing a constant stream of data, like someone recording audio with"
" a microphone.\n"
"- Reading code and converting it into instructions the computer "
"understands.\n"
"- Various intermediate to advanced-level algorithms, like finding paths "
"around a map for AI."

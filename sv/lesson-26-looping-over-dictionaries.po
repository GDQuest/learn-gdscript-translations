"You can loop over dictionaries, just like you learned to loop over arrays. "
"When you loop over a dictionary, you get its keys one by one. You can then "
"use each key to get its value."
msgstr ""

msgid "Let's see how this works with two examples."

"To display the player's inventory, you need to know what it contains: the "
"name and amount of each item."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To do this, you loop over the dictionary and process each key-value pair one "
"at a time."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can get the list of all the keys in a dictionary by calling its "
"[code]keys()[/code] function."

msgid ""
"Looping over dictionary keys is so common that GDScript gives you a shortcut."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can write the dictionary variable name directly after the [code]in[/"
"code] keyword in a [code]for[/code] loop. GDScript automatically loops over "
"the dictionary's keys."
msgstr ""

#: course/lesson-26-looping-over-dictionaries/lesson.tres:71
msgid ""
"Remember: the name after the [code]for[/code] keyword is a variable name you "
"choose yourself. You could call it [code]item_name[/code], [code]item[/"
"code], [code]key[/code], or anything else. This variable holds one key at a "
"time as the loop runs."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can get each value with the syntax [code]dictionary[key][/code], as you "
"learned in the previous lesson."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"So we can loop over the inventory keys, get their values, and display that "
"information on screen."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Instead of printing the key-value pairs to the output console, we can write "
"and call a function that displays items on the screen."

msgid "Mapping grid cells to units"
msgstr ""

#: course/lesson-26-looping-over-dictionaries/lesson.tres:135
msgid ""
"You can also use a dictionary to store which units are at which positions on "
"a game board."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is how you'd typically code a board game, a grid-based RPG, or a "
"tactical RPG."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"So far, we used [code]String[/code] keys. But GDScript dictionaries can use "
"any type as a key. In this example, we use [code]Vector2[/code] values as "
"keys to represent grid positions."
msgstr ""

msgid "The only rule is that every key in a dictionary must be unique."
msgstr ""

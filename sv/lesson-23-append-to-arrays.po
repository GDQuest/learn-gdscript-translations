"In previous lessons, you learned how to create arrays to store lists of "
"values and how to loop over them. That's useful, but arrays can do much more."

"The real strength of GDScript arrays is that you can add and remove values "
"from them at any time. This lets you build waiting lines of data or piles of "
"data. We call these [i]queues[/i] and [i]stacks[/i], respectively. We'll see "
"what that means in this lesson."

"In the example below, customers order meals that end up in a waiting line (a "

"When a customer purchases a meal, you want to [i]append[/i] (add) it to the "
"array. Then, as you complete a meal in the kitchen and serve it, you want to "
"remove it from the array."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can use the [code]append()[/code] function to add values at the end of "
"an array. To remove values from the start, you can use the [code]pop_front()"
"[/code] function. We call it \"pop\" because the value jumps out of the "

"Notice how we call some functions by writing a dot after a variable name. "
"Just like some values have variables you can access with a dot (like the "
"[code]x[/code] variable in [code]position.x[/code]), they can also have "
"their own functions."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Functions like [code]append()[/code] and [code]pop_front()[/code] only exist "

"A [code]String[/code] is a value type which holds text. To create a "
"[code]String[/code], you write text wrapped in quotation marks ([code]\"\"[/"
"code]). For example: [code]\"This is a text string.\"[/code]"

"The quotation marks differentiate strings from other value types and "
"function names."

"Under the hood, strings are arrays of characters. In fact, we can use a "

"Much like how [code]Vector2[/code] variables make calculations easier, "

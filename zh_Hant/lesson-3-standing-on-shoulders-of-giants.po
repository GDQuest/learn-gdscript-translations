"You'll learn what functions are and how they work in great detail in the "

"\n"
"A function is a bundle of code you can execute anytime. It's a named list"
" of instructions.\n"
"\n"
"To define a function, you need to write the [code]func[/code] keyword, "
"the function's name, parentheses, and a colon: [code]func run():[/code] "
"defines a function named [code]run()[/code].\n"
"\n"
"You then go to the next line to write the function's body. That's the "
"instructions of the function.\n"
"\n"
"Notice how each instruction starts with a leading [code]Tab[/code] "
"character. The computer uses that to know which lines are part of the "
"function.\n"
"\n"
"Throughout the course, you'll see many functions called "
"[code]run()[/code].\n"
"\n"
"Those are functions we created to give you interactive examples."

"在GDScript中，不像某些其他語言，我們一定得將我們的程式碼寫在客制函式中。\n"
"\n"
"你會在課程中學到函式是什麼、它們運作上的各種細節，但如果你會好奇的話，在這邊"
"先做簡介。\n"
"\n"
"函式是你能隨時執行的程式碼集合包。是個有名字的指令清單。\n"
"\n"
"要定義一個函式，你必須寫下關鍵字[code]func[/code]（函式Function的縮寫），函是"
"的名字，小括號，以及冒號：[code]func "
"run():[/code]定義了一個名為[code]run()[/code]的函式。\n"
"\n"
"你接下來到下一行寫下函式的本體。也就是函式的指令們。\n"
"\n"
"請注意每個指令都由一個[code]欄標（Tab）[/code]字元開頭。電腦用此得知哪一行是"
"函式的一部分。\n"

"The [code]0.3[/code] part between the parentheses is the function's "
"[i]argument[/i].\n"
"\n"
"Arguments are values (numbers, bits of text, and more) that change how "
"the function behaves.\n"
"\n"
"Arguments let you fine-tune the effect of the function call. They can be "
"optional at times, but functions often require arguments in order to "
"work.\n"
"\n"
"For example, calling [code]rotate()[/code] without any argument would "
"result in an error. Without an argument, Godot doesn't know by [i]how "
"much[/i] you intend to rotate the [i]sprite[/i].\n"
"\n"

"accepts! As a programmer, the documentation will always be close by for "
"you to refer to.\n"
"\n"

"小括號中間的[code]0.3[/code]部份便是函式的[i]引數[/i]。\n"
"\n"
"引數是能改變函式行為的值（數字、一些文字等等）。\n"
"\n"
"引數讓你能細細調整函式呼叫的效果。有時不填也沒關係，但函式通常會需要引數才能"
"運作。\n"
"\n"
"例如，不使用引數呼叫[code]rotate()[/code]會導致錯誤。沒有引數，Godot不知道你"
"希望[i]圖像（Sprite）[/i]要旋轉[i]多少[/i]。\n"
"\n"
"別擔心要記住每個函式需要或接受的引數！作為程式設計師，說明文件永遠會出現在你"
"能輕易查看的地方。\n"

"最後，請注意我們在上面的[code]0.3[/code]使用了小數點：你需要用這種點來表示小"

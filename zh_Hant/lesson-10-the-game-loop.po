"As we've seen, Godot has functions that do certain actions. For example, the "
"[code]show()[/code] and [code]hide()[/code] functions change the visibility "
"of things.\n"
"\n"
"We can also create our own functions to make custom effects like adding or "
"removing health to a character.\n"
"\n"
"Godot also has special functions we can customize or add to.\n"
"\n"
"Take the [code]_process()[/code] function."
msgstr ""
"正如我們所見，Godot 內建了一些執行特定動作的函式。例如，[code]show()[/code] "
"和 [code]hide()[/code] 函式可以改變物件的可見性。\n"
"\n"
"我們也可以創建自己的函式，以實現自訂效果，例如為角色增加或減少血量。\n"
"\n"
"此外，Godot 還提供了一些特殊的函式，允許我們自訂或擴充其行為。\n"
"\n"
"以 [code]_process()[/code] 函式為例。"

"The [code]_process()[/code] function gets its name because it does "
"calculations or continuous actions.\n"
"\n"
"It's like a juice factory that [b]processes[/b] juice bottles: the bottles "
"are always moving along a conveyor belt, while different machines operate on "
"them."
msgstr ""
"[code]_process()[/code] "
"函式之所以叫這個名字，是因為它負責執行計算或持續進行的動作。\n"
"\n"
"它就像一座果汁工廠，[b]處理[/b] "
"果汁瓶：瓶子會一直沿著輸送帶移動，而不同的機器會對它們進行加工。"

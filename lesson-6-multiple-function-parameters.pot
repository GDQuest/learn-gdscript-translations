"For now, focus on the first line, the function [i]definition[/i]: "

"The word [code]radians[/code] is the function's parameter. It's the "

msgid ""
"When you [i]call[/i] this function with [code]rotate(0.5)[/code], the "

"To add a parameter, write a placeholder name inside the parentheses. When"

"You can give parameters any name! How you name functions and parameters "

"Parameters make your code easier to reuse. You write the function once as"

"Here's an example with a function to draw any square. The parameter "

"To define a function, you need to start with the [code]func[/code] "

msgstr ""

"However, because we use the comma to separate parameters, it doesn't "

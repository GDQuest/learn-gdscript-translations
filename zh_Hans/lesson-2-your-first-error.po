"Especially professionals.\n"
"\n"
"At school, maybe you learned that mistakes are a bad thing. When you code "

"在学校里，你可能认为犯错是坏事。当编写代码时，情况并非如此：[b]这些错误可以帮"

"Error messages are designed on purpose by fellow programmers who came before "
"you. They anticipated you might have specific issues and wanted to help you "
"fix them.\n"
"\n"
"You shouldn't think of errors as failures. They are like mentors helping you "
"from the past. Importantly, errors won't break your computer. At least not "
"with GDScript because it's a pretty safe language.\n"
"\n"
"Ultimately, you want to fix all the errors in your program. Understanding "
"what is causing the errors, with the help of error messages, is key to "

"错误信息是在你之前的程序员有意设计的。他们预计你会遇到特定的问题，并希望帮助"

"你不应该把错误理解为自己的失败。它们是来自过去的导师，是来帮助你的。重要的是"
"，错误并不会破坏你的电脑。至少用 GDScript "
"的时候不会，因为这是一门相当安全的语言。\n"
"\n"
"最终，你需要修复程序中的所有错误。在错误信息的帮助下，了解导致错误的原因，这"
"是修复错误的关键。"

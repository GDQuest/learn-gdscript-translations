"At first, you will not need [code]while[/code] loops often. Even the code we "
"show here has more efficient alternatives.\n"
"\n"
"Also, there's a safer kind of loop, [code]for[/code] loops, which we'll look "
"at in the next lesson.\n"
"\n"
"Yet, [code]while[/code] loops have important intermediate to advanced-level "
"uses, so you at least need to know they exist and how to use them.\n"
"\n"
"We use [code]while[/code] loops every time we need to loop an unknown number "
"of times.\n"
"\n"
"For example, games run in a loop that typically generates sixty images per "
"second until the user closes the game. This is possible thanks to "
"[code]while[/code] loops.\n"
"\n"
"There are other good uses for [code]while[/code] loops:\n"
"\n"
"- Reading and processing a file, like a text document, line by line.\n"
"- Processing a constant stream of data, like someone recording audio with a "
"microphone.\n"
"- Reading code and converting it into instructions the computer "
"understands.\n"
"- Various intermediate to advanced-level algorithms, like finding paths "
"around a map for AI."

"In the previous lesson, you used a predefined member variable named "
"[code]position[/code].\n"

"In your projects, you will need to define your own variables.\n"

"Imagine that you need to track the player's health in your game.\n"
"\n"
"They may start with [code]5[/code] health points. When taking a hit, the "
"health should go down to [code]4[/code]. After another hit, it should be "
"[code]3[/code]. And so on.\n"
"\n"
"To keep track of that, you can create a variable named "
"[code]health[/code] to which you add and subtract points.\n"
"\n"
"The example below introduces the [code]print()[/code] function, which "
"outputs its argument to the output box on the left.\n"

"[code]health[/code] variable."

"To use a variable, you must first define it so the computer registers its"

"\n"
"To do so, you start a line of code with the [code]var[/code] keyword "

" [i]function[/i], [code]var[/code] stands for [i]variable[/i].\n"
"\n"
"Variables are case-sensitive, which means [code]health[/code] and "
"[code]Health[/code] are technically different variables. Be careful to "
"use the same capitalization wherever you refer to the same variable, or "
"you could be reading or writing to a different variable.\n"

"The following line defines a [code]health[/code] variable pointing to no "

"stick onto something."

msgid "In the last lesson, we used an array to represent a player's inventory."
msgstr ""
"마지막 수업에서 우리는 배열을 사용하여 플레이어의 인벤토리를 나타냈습니다."

msgid ""
"With just an array of item names, though, we can't easily keep track of the "
"amount of each item."
msgstr ""
"하지만 단순히 아이템 이름만 있는 배열로는 각 아이템의 수량을 쉽게 추적할 수 "
"없습니다."

msgid ""
"Instead, we can bundle the item names and amounts into a single "
"[i]dictionary[/i]."
msgstr "대신, 아이템 이름과 수량을 하나의 [i]딕셔너리[/i]에 묶을 수 있습니다."

msgid ""
"A dictionary is a data structure that allows you to map pairs of values. In "
"the pair, we call the first value a [i]key[/i] as we use it to access the "
"second."
msgstr ""
"딕셔너리는 값 쌍을 매핑할 수 있는 데이터 구조입니다. 이 쌍에서 첫 번째 값을 "
"[i]키[/i]라고 부르며, 이를 사용하여 두 번째 값에 접근합니다."

msgid ""
"In other words, a dictionary has a list of [i]keys[/i], and each key points "
"to a [i]value[/i]."
msgstr ""
"다시 말해, 딕셔너리는 [i]키[/i] 목록을 가지고 있으며, 각 키는 [i]값[/i]을 가"
"리킵니다."

msgid ""
"To define a dictionary, we use curly brackets. A colon separates each key "
"and its value. A comma separates each key and value pair."
msgstr ""
"딕셔너리를 정의하려면 중괄호를 사용합니다. 콜론은 각 키와 그 값을 구분하고, "
"쉼표는 각 키와 값 쌍을 구분합니다."

msgid "Dictionaries can map about any value to any other value."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For example, we can use the name of an item as a key and the amount as the "
"corresponding value. This makes dictionaries excellent for keeping track of "
"a player's inventory."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Here we matched the name (a string) to the amount (a number). But a key "
"could be a string, a number, or even a vector!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Although we can have all of these different keys, keep in mind that every "
"key has to be [i]unique[/i]. That means we [i]couldn't[/i] have a dictionary "

msgid "How dictionaries work under the hood"
msgstr ""

#: course/lesson-25-creating-dictionaries/lesson.tres:122
msgid ""
"Dictionaries are also called mappings or [i]associative arrays[/i]. Under "
"the hood, they use arrays and several functions to efficiently store and "
"retrieve values across arrays."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Precisely, dictionaries use a [i]hashing algorithm[/i]. Hashing algorithms "
"convert one value into another."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In this case, hashing consists of converting a given key into a unique whole "
"number. The dictionary then uses that number as an array's index!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"That's how a dictionary works: when you give it a key, it converts it into a "
"unique index and uses that index to retrieve the corresponding value in the "
"computer's memory."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"That's also why you can't have the same key twice: it would map to the same "
"array index, causing you to overwrite an existing value."
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

#: course/lesson-25-creating-dictionaries/lesson.tres:140

msgstr ""

#: course/lesson-25-creating-dictionaries/lesson.tres:171
msgid ""
"We need to make sure the key is the same as we defined in the dictionary."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In our case, [code]var item_count = inventory[\"gems\"][/code] is correct."

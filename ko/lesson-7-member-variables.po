msgid "In this lesson, we take a first look at variables."
msgstr "이 수업에서는 변수에 대해 처음으로 살펴봅니다."

msgid "In games, you need to keep track of many values that change over time:"
msgstr "게임에서는 시간이 지남에 따라 변하는 많은 값을 추적해야 합니다:"

msgid ""
"- The player's score.\n"
"- Every character or enemy's health.\n"
"- The last checkpoint."
msgstr ""
"- 플레이어의 점수.\n"
"- 모든 캐릭터나 적의 체력.\n"
"- 마지막 체크포인트."

msgid "And so much more. You need to store, retrieve, and update those values."
msgstr "그리고 그 외에도 많은 것들이 있습니다. 이러한 값을 저장하고, 검색하고, 업데이트해야 합니다."

msgid ""
"We call those values [i]variables[/i]. Variables are labels you use to "
"keep track of values that vary over time. Here's an example of a variable"
" tracking a character or monster's health."
msgstr ""
"이러한 값을 우리는 [i]변수[/i]라고 부릅니다. 변수는 시간이 지남에 따라 변하는 값을 추적하기 위해 사용하는 레이블입니다. "
"캐릭터나 몬스터의 체력을 추적하는 변수의 예는 다음과 같습니다."

"The line above defines a new variable named [code]health[/code] and "

"sign does, more on that below)."
msgstr ""
"위의 줄은 [code]health[/code]라는 새로운 변수를 정의하고 시작 값으로 [code]100[/code]을 할당합니다 "
"(등호가 하는 일이 바로 이것입니다. 이에 대해서는 아래에서 더 자세히 설명하겠습니다)."

"Function parameters, which you saw in the previous lesson, are another "

"In this lesson, we start using variables built into Godot. They're a "
"particular kind called [i]member variables[/i]."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Member variables are values attached to a game entity. They're useful "
"properties like the [code]position[/code], [code]rotation[/code], and "
"[code]scale[/code] of a character."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In a previous lesson, we saw how we could use the [code]rotate()[/code] "
"function to rotate our character."
msgstr ""

#: course/lesson-7-member-variables/lesson.tres:80
msgid ""
"This function increases or decreases the value of the entity's "
"[code]rotation[/code] member variable."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Say we want to reset the rotation to [code]0[/code] and make the "
"character upright. Using the [code]rotate()[/code] function can prove "
"difficult: you need to know the character's exact current angle to cancel"
" it out."
msgstr ""

msgid "It's much easier to use the member variable rather than the function."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The following code assigns the value [code]0[/code] to the character's "
"rotation, resetting its angle and making it upright."
msgstr ""

#: course/lesson-7-member-variables/lesson.tres:106
msgid ""
"Notice how we use the equal sign ([code]=[/code]) to change the value of "

msgid "What's a variable?"
msgstr ""

#: course/lesson-7-member-variables/lesson.tres:117
msgid "Variables are labels you use to access values that change over time."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can also use them to put a name on a value you want to reuse "
"throughout your code. It makes your code easier to read and to change."
msgstr ""

msgid "A label you use to keep track of a value that can change."

msgid "Accessing sub-variables with the dot"
msgstr ""

#: course/lesson-7-member-variables/lesson.tres:130
msgid "In video games, you will see many member variables that have sub-values."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For example, the [code]position[/code] we mentioned has two coordinates: "
"[code]x[/code] and [code]y[/code]."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It's the same for the [code]scale[/code]: it has [code]x[/code] and "
"[code]y[/code] sub-variables. They respectively control the horizontal "
"and vertical size of the game entity."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To access those X and Y sub-components, you add a dot (\".\") after the "
"variable name."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The code below places the entity at [code]200[/code] pixels on the x-axis"
" and [code]250[/code] pixels on the y-axis."
msgstr ""

#: course/lesson-7-member-variables/lesson.tres:158
msgid ""
"Notice how we use the equal sign (\"=\") to assign the numbers on the "
"right to the sub-variables on the left."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Unlike in maths, in computer programming, the equal sign (\"=\") does not"
" mean \"is equal to.\""
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Instead, it means \"assign the result of the expression on the right to "
"the variable on the left\". We assign values so often in code that we "
"prefer to reserve the equal sign for that."
msgstr ""

#: course/lesson-7-member-variables/lesson.tres:170
msgid "In games, the Y-axis is positive going down"
msgstr ""

#: course/lesson-7-member-variables/lesson.tres:172
msgid ""
"Note that in games, assuming your character's position starts at (0, 0), "
"the code above moves the entity [code]200[/code] pixels to the right and "
"[code]250[/code] pixels down."
msgstr ""

msgid "In math, the y-axis is generally positive going up by convention."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The convention is the [i]opposite[/i] in video games and many computer "
"applications: the y-axis is positive going down."
msgstr ""

#: course/lesson-7-member-variables/lesson.tres:194
msgid "Why does the Y-axis point downwards?"
msgstr ""

#: course/lesson-7-member-variables/lesson.tres:196
msgid ""
"This may be confusing if you only saw the y-axis pointing up in math "
"classes. However, in math, axes go in any direction. They don't even have"
" to be perpendicular."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On the computer, the position (0, 0) happens to correspond to the top-"
"left of your computer screen. It then makes sense for coordinates to be "
"positive when going towards the bottom-right corner."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This leads to another question: why is position zero the top left of the "
"screen? This is due to computer and TV displays history: they would "
"calculate and display pixels starting from the top left corner and moving"
" towards the bottom right corner."
msgstr ""

#: course/lesson-7-member-variables/lesson.tres:210
msgid ""
"Let's look at one last example before moving on to the practice. The "
"following code makes the character 1.5 times its starting size."

msgid "How do you access sub-variables?"
msgstr ""

#: course/lesson-7-member-variables/lesson.tres:229
msgid ""
"Variables often hold sub-values, like the [code]position[/code] has two "
"sub-variables: [code]x[/code] and [code]y[/code]. How would you access "
"the [code]x[/code], for example?"
msgstr ""

#: course/lesson-7-member-variables/lesson.tres:231
msgid ""
"To access a sub-variable, you need to write a dot between the parent "
"variable name and the sub-variable name."

"For example, to access the [code]x[/code] sub-variable of the "
"[code]position[/code] variable, you'll write [code]position.x[/code]."

msgstr ""

msgid "For now, just know you can use the dot to access them."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We'll tell you which variables have sub-components and what their names "
"are."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the next lessons, you'll create your own variables and do operations "
"on them to add or remove [code]score[/code], [code]health[/code], you "

"Draw three squares of size 100 by 100 that are 100 pixels apart on the "

msgstr ""

"You should draw the squares starting at the position (100, 100). This "

"Remember you need to use the equal sign ([code]=[/code]) to change the "

"For example, the [code]round()[/code] function takes a decimal number as an "

"Notice how we assign the result of the function call to a variable. Because "
"the [code]round()[/code] function returns a [i]new[/i] value, we need to "

msgid ""
"It takes three arguments: a start value, an end value, and a blend amount "
"between [code]0.0[/code] and [code]1.0[/code] that controls the blend. A "
"value of [code]0.0[/code] gives you the start value, [code]1.0[/code] gives "
"you the end value, and [code]0.5[/code] gives you halfway between them."

msgid ""
"In games, [code]lerp()[/code] is often used to make things move smoothly "

"In previous lessons, we had characters walking on grids. For those "

"But cell coordinates are not the same as positions on the screen. A cell "

"positions."

"We can write a function to convert cell coordinates to pixel positions. "

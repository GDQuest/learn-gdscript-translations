"Until now, you learned that functions are sequences of instructions you "
"give a name and you can call any time."
msgstr "지금까지 함수는 이름을 붙여 언제든지 호출할 수 있는 일련의 명령어라는 것을 배웠습니다."

msgid ""
"On top of that, functions can make calculations and [i]return[/i] new "
"values."
msgstr "그뿐만 아니라, 함수는 계산을 수행하고 새로운 값을 [i]반환[/i]할 수 있습니다."

msgid "Let's look at some examples to see why it's useful."

"Many functions built into GDScript make calculations and return a new "
"value."

msgid ""
"For example, the [code]round()[/code] function takes a decimal number as "
"an argument and gives you back a new number rounded to the nearest digit."

"Imagine you have a game where you track the player's health as a "
"percentage, a decimal number going from [code]0.0[/code] to "
"[code]100.0[/code]."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When displaying the health on the interface, you don't want to show the "
"decimal part. In that case, you may use the [code]round()[/code] "
"function, like so."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Notice how we assign the result of the function call to a variable. "
"Because the [code]round()[/code] function returns a [i]new[/i] value, we "
"need to either store the result or use the value immediately."
msgstr ""

msgid "Above, we assigned it to a variable, but you could also do the following."

"Every frame, the code calculates a position somewhere between the turtle "

"It's not the most robust approach for smooth movement, as you'll learn in"

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To make a function return a value, you use the [code]return[/code] "
"keyword followed by the value in question."
msgstr ""

msgid "In previous lessons, we had characters walking on grids."
msgstr ""

msgid "And for those practices, you were working directly with cell coordinates."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Well, cell coordinates don't correspond to positions on the screen. To "
"find the center of any cell on the screen, we need to convert the cell's "
"coordinates to a position on the screen, in pixels."
msgstr ""

#: course/lesson-22-functions-return-values/lesson.tres:177
msgid "To do so, we use a function. The function does two things:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"1. First, it multiplies the cell coordinates by the cell size, which "
"gives us the position of the cell's top-left corner on the screen, in "
"pixels.\n"
"2. Then, we add half of the cell size to get the center of the cell."
msgstr ""

msgid "The function returns the result, allowing us to store it in a variable."
msgstr ""

#: course/lesson-22-functions-return-values/lesson.tres:202
msgid ""
"The [code]return[/code] keyword returns the value to the code calling the"
" function. You'll receive the result where you call the function."

msgid ""
"Some functions return values, and some do not. During practices, you can "
"learn which functions return a value using the documentation panel. It "
"will display if the practice requires using specific functions or "
"variables."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There, functions that start with the term [code]void[/code] do not return"
" a value. Any other term means the function does return a value. You'll "

"You've seen that you can use functions to [i]reuse[/i] code. In this lesson, "
"you'll learn about [b]loops[/b]. Loops help you [i]repeat[/i] code.\n"
"\n"
"To illustrate how loops work, let's take a game board split into a grid.\n"
"\n"
"Our robot can move to neighboring cells by changing a [code]Vector2[/code] "
"variable named [code]cell[/code]. It represents the current cell the robot "
"is in.\n"
"\n"
"When we increase [code]cell.x[/code], the robot moves to the right.\n"
"\n"
"Note that we delay the robot's movement in the app to help you visualize how "
"it moves. The following code would normally move the robot instantly."

"Om te laten zien hoe lussen werken, nemen we een bord dat is opgedeeld door "
"een raster.\n"

"Onze robot kan naar naburige cellen bewegen door een [code]Vector2[/code] "
"variabele genaamd [code]cell[/code] te bewerken. Deze vertegenwoordigt het "
"huidige vakje waar de robot zich bevindt.\n"
"\n"
"Wanneer we [code]cell.x[/code] verhogen, beweegt de robot naar rechts.\n"
"\n"
"Merk op dat we de beweging van de robot in de app vertragen om je te helpen "
"te zien hoe hij beweegt. De volgende code zou de robot normaal gesproken "
"onmiddellijk verplaatsen."

"size of the board was different. \n"
"\n"
"The robot would either stop before the end or go too far.\n"
"\n"
"To implement a general solution for all board sizes, we can repeat the "
"robot's movement until it gets to the end.\n"
"\n"
"For code that repeats, we can use [i]loops[/i]."

"At first, you will not need [code]while[/code] loops often. Even the code we "
"show here has more efficient alternatives.\n"
"\n"
"Also, there's a safer kind of loop, [code]for[/code] loops, which we'll look "
"at in the next lesson.\n"
"\n"
"Yet, [code]while[/code] loops have important intermediate to advanced-level "
"uses, so you at least need to know they exist and how to use them.\n"
"\n"
"We use [code]while[/code] loops every time we need to loop an unknown number "
"of times.\n"
"\n"
"For example, games run in a loop that typically generates sixty images per "
"second until the user closes the game. This is possible thanks to "
"[code]while[/code] loops.\n"
"\n"
"There are other good uses for [code]while[/code] loops:\n"
"\n"
"- Reading and processing a file, like a text document, line by line.\n"
"- Processing a constant stream of data, like someone recording audio with a "
"microphone.\n"
"- Reading code and converting it into instructions the computer "
"understands.\n"
"- Various intermediate to advanced-level algorithms, like finding paths "
"around a map for AI."

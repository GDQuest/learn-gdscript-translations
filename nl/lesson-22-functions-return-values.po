"You can make [i]your[/i] functions return values.\n"
"\n"
"To make a function return a value, you use the [code]return[/code] keyword "
"followed by the value in question.\n"
"\n"
"In previous lessons, we had characters walking on grids.\n"
"\n"
"And for those practices, you were working directly with cell coordinates.\n"
"\n"
"Well, cell coordinates don't correspond to positions on the screen. To find "
"the center of any cell on the screen, we need to convert the cell's "
"coordinates to a position on the screen, in pixels."

#: course/lesson-22-functions-return-values/lesson.tres:177

"To do so, we use a function. The function does two things:\n"
"\n"
"1. First, it multiplies the cell coordinates by the cell size, which gives "
"us the position of the cell's top-left corner on the screen, in pixels.\n"
"2. Then, we add half of the cell size to get the center of the cell.\n"
"\n"
"The function returns the result, allowing us to store it in a variable."

"Some functions return values, and some do not. During practices, you can "

"display if the practice requires using specific functions or variables.\n"
"\n"
"There, functions that start with the term [code]void[/code] do not return a "
"value. Any other term means the function does return a value. You'll learn "
"more about what other terms mean in a couple of lessons when we explore "
"value [i]types[/i].\n"

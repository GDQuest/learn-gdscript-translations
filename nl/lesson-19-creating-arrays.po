"The [code]range()[/code] function we saw in the previous lesson outputs a "

"A list of values, numbers or otherwise, has a precise name in code: we call "
"it an [i]array[/i]. So we can say calling the [code]range()[/code] function "
"produces an [i]array[/i] of numbers.\n"

"We could directly write and use that array inside our [code]for[/code] loop "

"As you can see, the code still works the same. Notice that when we create a "

"In games, you need allies or monsters to find their way to their target, "

"\n"
"To achieve that, we use [i]pathfinding algorithms[/i]. As the name suggests, "
"those algorithms find the path between two points and allow AIs to traverse "
"the game."

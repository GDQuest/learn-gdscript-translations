"By default, GDScript is what we call a dynamically-typed language. That "
"means that you can just write variables, assign them a value with a number, "
"and assign them another value with a different type.\n"
"\n"
"Unlike in some other languages, in GDScript, the following code is valid."

"Games use grids all the time, be it for grid-based gameplay or to make "
"algorithms faster.\n"
"\n"
"When working with grids, you need to convert grid coordinates into positions "
"in the game world all the time. To do so, you give each cell a size in "
"pixels.\n"
"\n"
"You'll likely pick one of two types for that: [code]float[/code] or "
"[code]Vector2[/code], because pixel positions on the screen use "
"[code]Vector2[/code] coordinates.\n"
"\n"
"Either of those two values would be fine:"

#: course/lesson-28-specifying-types/lesson.tres:71

"Using a [code]Vector2[/code] could simplify some calculations. For example, "
"when converting grid coordinates to game world coordinates."

"In this example, because both [code]cell[/code] and [code]cell_size[/code] "
"are [code]Vector2[/code] values, we can add them.\n"
"\n"
"However, if [code]cell_size[/code] is a [code]float[/code], we will get a "
"type error."

"Worse: due to dynamic typing, we won't get an error [i]right away[/i]. We "
"will only get the error when calling [code]grid_to_world(Vector2(1, 1))[/"
"code].\n"
"\n"
"And that's a big problem."

"Because we're learning, we only have small code examples in this course. But "
"your games' code will get long and split into many files. When coding, you "
"often forget about the code you wrote several weeks ago.\n"
"\n"
"And with a lot of code, it could take [i]hours[/i] of play before players "
"trigger a type error in your code."

"Fortunately, GDScript has optional [i]type hints[/i].\n"
"\n"
"Type hints let the computer know the value type you want for variables and "
"report errors before running the code.\n"
"\n"
"To specify the type a variable can accept, you can write a colon and a type "
"after the name when defining a new variable."

"GDScript comes with a feature called [i]type inference[/i]. In many cases, "
"but not all, the computer can figure out the type of a variable for you.\n"
"\n"
"To do so, you write [code]:=[/code], without the type. The computer will set "
"the type using the value after the equal sign. We could make "
"[code]cell_size[/code] a variable of type [code]Vector2[/code] like so:"

"This takes little typing, yet you get the benefits of using type hints, like "

"When you give the language hints like that, it will [i]prevent[/i] major "
"type errors. When you work in Godot, you will see that the computer can "
"report issues as you write the code. It makes the benefit even greater.\n"
"\n"
"Type hints can also help improve the readability of your code. It can help "
"to put more information directly in the code. As we saw, types are essential "
"when coding, and when using type hints, the computer will add them to the "
"engine's built-in code documentation system.\n"
"\n"
"There's an incredible third benefit for you: by using type hints, you will "
"learn types much faster. It's excellent for learning.\n"
"\n"
"In the following practices, you will write the correct type hints to make "
"the code error-free."

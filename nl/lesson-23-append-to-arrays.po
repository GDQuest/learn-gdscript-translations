"In previous lessons, you learned how to create arrays to store lists of "
"values and how to loop over them. It's nice, but you won't go far with only "
"that.\n"
"\n"
"The real strength of arrays is that you can add and remove values from them "
"at any time. It allows you to [i]queue[/i] or [i]stack[/i] data."

"You're making a restaurant management game where customers place orders, and "
"you need to handle them as they come.\n"

"How do you keep track of pending and completed orders? With an array!\n"
"\n"
"When a customer purchases a meal, you want to [i]append[/i] it to the array. "
"Then, as you complete a meal in the kitchen and serve it, you want to remove "
"it from the array.\n"
"\n"
"You can do that with the [code]append()[/code] and the [code]pop_front()[/"
"code] functions of the array, respectively.\n"
"\n"
"Try to read the code below before moving on. Don't worry if not everything "
"makes sense, as we'll break it all down."

"Notice how we call some functions by writing a dot after a variable name. "
"Like a given value type can have sub-variables, it can also have its own "
"functions.\n"
"\n"
"Functions like [code]append()[/code] and [code]pop_front()[/code] only exist "
"on arrays. That's why to call them, we need to access it from the array "

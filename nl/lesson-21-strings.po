"A [code]String[/code] is a value type which holds text. To create a "
"[code]String[/code], you write text wrapped in quotation marks ([code]\"\"[/"
"code]). For example: [code]\"This is a text string.\"[/code]\n"
"\n"
"The quotation marks differentiate strings from other value types and "
"function names.\n"
"\n"
"You may remember we've used strings before in previous lessons."

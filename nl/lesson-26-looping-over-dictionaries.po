"Like with arrays, you can loop over dictionaries. You can loop over both "
"their keys and values.\n"

"Let's see how it works with two examples."

"To display the player's inventory, you need to know what it contains. You "
"need the name and amount of each object.\n"
"\n"
"And from code, you can only achieve that by looping over the whole "
"dictionary and processing key-value pairs one by one.\n"
"\n"
"To get the list of keys in the dictionary, you can call its [code]keys()[/"
"code] member function."

"But it's something we do so much that you don't need to call the function.\n"
"\n"
"Instead, you can directly [ignore]type the variable name in a [code]for[/"
"code] loop after the [code]in[/code] keyword. The language understands that "
"you implicitly want to loop over the dictionary's keys."

"You can get the values with the syntax [code]dictionary[key][/code] as you "

"Instead of printing the key-value pairs to the output console, we can code "

"We can also use a dictionary to map units to their position on a game "

"\n"
"That's how you'd typically code a board game, a grid-based RPG, or a "
"tactical RPG.\n"
"\n"
"While we focused on [code]String[/code] keys so far, GDScript dictionaries "
"accept any value type as a key, allowing you to map anything to anything.\n"
"\n"
"The only limitation is that every key must be unique."

"We use a dictionary to represent the player's inventory in this game. The "
